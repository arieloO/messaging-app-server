# messaging-app-server

Little Node.js Chat App made with Express &amp; Socket.io.

It handles user messages, user login/logout and "user is typing"

The client interface I built with React is deployed here : [Chat App](https://messaging-app-client-kgvp0buv6-arieloo.vercel.app/), best way to try it is to open two windows to chat with yourself ;)
