# messaging-app-server

Little Node.js Chat App made with Express &amp; Socket.io.

The client interface I built with React is deployed here : [Chat App](https://messaging-app-client-kgvp0buv6-arieloo.vercel.app/),

the best way to try it is to open it twice on separate windows and chat with yourself XD
